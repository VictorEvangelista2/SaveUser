<h1 style="font-family: Arial; margin-top: 20px;">Introduction</h1>

<h3>This project aims to create a user registration system using JavaScript. In it, the user's name will be inserted into a table to facilitate data management and visualization.</h3>
<h3>Functions in JavaScript play a crucial role in interacting with tables on a web page, making the application more dynamic and functional. They allow data to be entered, manipulated and displayed in the table efficiently and interactively. Therefore, the project will have the following functions:</h3>

 - [x] email login and password
 - [x] Redirect to registration
 - [x] Registration of Name, Email, Password and CPF
 - [x] Data interface through table
 - [x] Delete and edit in real time

<h1>Development</h1> 

<h2>In this chapter we will present the functions in JavaScript that relate to the user experience in such a way that changes it to a more dynamic and functional way.</h2>

<h2> 1. Function "Acessar"</h2>

#### This function checks whether the email and password fields are filled in and, if so, redirects the user to another page. Otherwise, it displays a message asking you to fill in all the fields.

<h2> 2. Function "salvarUser"</h2>

#### This code allows the user to enter a name into a text field. If the name is provided, it is saved in a list and the interface is updated to reflect the new data. If the field is empty, the user receives an alert asking to enter a name.

<h2> 3. Function "criaLista"</h2>

#### This createList() function dynamically generates an HTML table that lists all usernames stored in dataList. It also adds "Edit" and "Delete" buttons for each row, allowing the user to interact with the data directly in the table, making the page more interactive and functional.

<h2> 4. Function "Editar Nomes"</h2>

#### The edit function is a tool for modifying a list of names, allowing you to select a name, edit it in a text field, and update the original list with the new information.

<h2> 5. Função "Excluir Nomes"</h2> 

#### The delete function is like scissors for lists and tables. You indicate which item you want to cut (by index) and it removes it from both the internal list (where the data is stored) and the visual table (where the user sees the list).

#### This function is very common in web applications that allow users to manage lists of items, such as to-do lists, contacts, products in a shopping cart, etc. When clicking a "Delete" button next to an item, this function would be called to remove the item from the list and interface.

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

### A web application that allows the user to create a table with names entered by him, with deletion and editing functionalities, an application like this offers a simple and intuitive interface for the user to manage a list of names, providing the basic functionalities of editing and delete.

<h1 style="margin-top: 30px;"> Implementação de validação do CPF </h1>

#### This JavaScript code validates the entry of a CPF and provides feedback to the user. It first checks whether a CPF has been entered and then uses the "validarCPF" function to determine its validity. If the CPF is invalid, a red message is displayed; if it is valid, the message appears in green. Using clear colors and messaging improves the user experience by ensuring input errors are handled appropriately.
